# Far-Field Diffraction Imaging System Using Computer-Generated Hologram

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a far-field diffraction imaging system using a Computer-Generated Hologram (CGH). The project demonstrates the principles of optical diffraction and holography by processing an input image to generate its far-field diffraction pattern and phase-encoded hologram. 

The CGH hologram generated by this system is specifically designed for use with a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) device, making it suitable for experimental applications involving interferometry.

## Features
- **Input Image Processing**:
  - Reads and displays the input image.
  - Converts the image to grayscale and processes it into a binary format.
- **Hologram Optimization**:
  - Iteratively optimizes phase and intensity using the Fourier transform.
  - Visualizes Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for convergence.
- **Visualization**:
  - Displays the input image, binary image, cost function optimization progress, CGH hologram, and far-field diffraction pattern.
- **Output Generation**:
  - Saves the generated hologram as an image file (`output.png`).

## Key Details
- **Figure 4: CGH Hologram**:
  - This figure represents the hologram image for an LCoS device. 
  - It demonstrates the phase value for every pixel on the LCoS.
  - The output image can be experimentally reproduced using an interferometry setup with the LCoS device, enabling practical validation of the generated hologram.
- **Output Image**:
  - The far-field diffraction pattern produced by the hologram is a direct result of applying the CGH principles and can be used to study diffraction characteristics.
